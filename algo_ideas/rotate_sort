in certain case, the stack can be sorted by rotation only (5 1 2 3 4 is sorted by rra for example). in this case, while the standart push_swap will work, it is not fully optimised. so, before even trying anything else, we will see if it may work.

algo : (all moves in this algo, unless dirrectly specified, are not accompanied by an output).

make a copy of sa. all stack modif will be on the copy rather than true sa.
rotate once
nb move = 1
while copy isn't sorted and copy first node != sa first node
	rotate copy;
	nb moves ++;
if copy is sorted
	if nb_moves < len/2 (might need to correct values and direction)
		while nb_moves --
			printf rotate
	else
		while nb_moves < len
	exit
else
	do nothing
